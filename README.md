# Hashomer Crypto Reference 

This repo includes the whitepaper and reference python implementation for our proposal for a Privacy-Preserving Bluetooth Based Contact Tracing Scheme for "Hamagen".

For details read the full paper [Hashomer](./documents/hashomer.pdf) at the documents folder.

Note that the current python reference implementation does not support sending or receiving daily keys by the user or the server; only epoch keys are supported.
